# Basic Interest Calculator

I completed this program as part of my HyperionDev Software Development Fundamentals bootcamp. The task was to create a simple Interest calculator program that met the following criteria: 

- The user should be able to choose which calculation they want to do, investment or bond

- Investment:
- If the user selects investment, they should be asked to input:
    - The amound of money they are depositing
    - The interest rate
    - The number of years they wish to invest
    - Simple or Compound Interest
- Using these inputs, we then output the amount they will get back after the given time, at given interest rate.

- Bond
- If the user selects Bond, they should be asked to input:
    - The current Value of the house
    - The interest rate
    - The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond
- Calculate the amount the user will have to pay month and output the answer

I have implemented the program in python, and you can find the source code in this repository.
